    <h2 id="course">Overview</h2>
    <p>Computational techniques have become an integral part of the research, with their importance and
        contribution to scientific discovery growing rapidly in recent years. The use of computational
        techniques in chemistry has made it possible to simulate chemical reactions and predict the properties
        of molecules with a high degree of accuracy.</p>

    <p>Additionally, molecular simulations have made it possible to study complex systems that are difficult,
        if not impossible, to study experimentally, such as large protein complexes, biological membranes,
        interactions of molecules and materials at the interface, and processes in space or in extreme conditions.
        These methods have had a positive impact on society by accelerating the development of new drugs, materials,
        and technologies.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it is essential for students to have a solid understanding of computational techniques and their
        applications in modern scientific methods. This part of the course focuses on molecular dynamics simulations,
        one of the most commonly used methodologies in current research. </p>
