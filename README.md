*An Introduction to Computational Chemistry Techniques* is an open educational resource originally developed for postgraduate taught master's chemistry students at the University of Edinburgh to introduce the practical aspects of molecular dynamics simulations.

Aimed at students with no prior experience in programming or computational chemistry, this module is delivered over a month as a series of three 3-hour workshops in a computer-lab setting, with a fourth session dedicated to individual projects.
