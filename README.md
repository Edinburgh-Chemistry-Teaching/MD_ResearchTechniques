# Introduction to Computational Chemistry Techniques

This is an open educational resource originally developed for postgraduate taught masters chemistry students at the University of Edinburgh to introduce the practical aspects of molecular dynamics simulations.

This course is designed for students with no prior experience in programming or computational chemistry. It is delivered over a month as a series of four 3-hour workshops in a computer-lab setting, with the final session dedicated to individual projects.

The course aims to equip students with practical skills necessary to perform meaningful molecular dynamics simulations, including: 

* Using basic command-line interfaces;
* Navigating and utilising high-performance computing resources;
* Preparing, running, and troubleshooting molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS software;
* Recognising the limitations of computational chemistry methods available;
* Applying these skills independently to real research systems.

In this repository, and with the associated manuscript, we share the materials with the hope that their future reuse and adaptation will benefit chemistry education across the globe.



## Files shared

* **Lectures** - each session begins with the introductory lecture, and all the slides are shared within. 
* **Notes** - HTML materials for self-guided work during each session. Start by opening `Overview.html` in your browser. Dyslexia-friendly settings are also available. 
* **Practicals** - all the files necessary to complete each session. 

Please note that we are not sharing the materials for Session 4, as those are used for a summative assessment. Nevertheless, we share an example report and the templates.

## Reusing and building on the material for your own course

The easiest way is by cloning the material and adapting it to your needs. This can be just using some partial material or expanding on the existing material. The best way to do this is by either [cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repo and building up on it, or using the current repository as a [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for your own or your organisations GitHub account, for more details see the [overview](overview.md) document.
