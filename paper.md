# Summary
An Introduction to Computational Chemistry Techniques is a resource designed to teach students the practical aspects of molecular dynamics simulations. 
It is a module was designed for taught postgraduate chemistry students with no prior knowledge of programming or practical computational chemistry. 
The course is taught over three 3-hour long workshops, introducing Unix command-line and use of 
GROMACS for molecular dynamics simulations, performing simulations on a high-performace computer. 
The corse is delivered in a computer-lab environment where the students work through the material at their own pace, assisted by demonstrators. 

# Statement of Need
[//]: # (taken from course overview)
Computational techniques have become an integral part of the research, with their importance and contribution to scientific discovery growing rapidly in recent years. The use of computational techniques in chemistry has made it possible to simulate chemical reactions and predict the properties of molecules with a high degree of accuracy.
Additionally, molecular simulations have made it possible to study complex systems that are difficult, if not impossible, to study experimentally, such as large protein complexes, biological membranes, interactions of molecules and materials at the interface, and processes in space or in extreme conditions. These methods have had a positive impact on society by accelerating the development of new drugs, materials, and technologies.
Therefore, it is essential for students to have a solid understanding of computational techniques and their applications in modern scientific 
methods. This module focuses on molecular dynamics simulations, one of the most commonly used methodologies in current research. 

# Content and Instructional Design

- talk about lectures at the start of the session + share the slides
- say that it is aimed at the students doing courses in materials, analytical and medbio. hence some modifications of the corse

## Learning objectives
The overarching aim of the course is to learn and understand the practical aspects of molecular simulations. Within this, the aims are:

- Use basic command-line interfaces.
- Use and understand the basics of high-performance computing resources.
- Prepare systems for molecular dynamics simulations and troubleshoot the set-up, simulations and analysis steps.
- Understand the limitations of the computational chemistry techniques used.
- Apply the skills independently onto a complex, real research systems.

## Session 1

## Session 2

## Session 3

## Assessment
The module was originally created as part of a postgraduate Research Techniques course at the University of Edinburgh, which aimed to teach students practical aspects of chemistry. The module contributes 40% of the total grade for the course. 
The module was assessed in two ways. Overall comprehension of the first two sessions is assessed based on multiple choice quizzes. Secondly, the 
students are tasked with completing an individual project building off of what they learn in session 3 and writing a short report on it.


# Reuse, implementation and modification

- also add the claycode w/sh for those who want to learn more
